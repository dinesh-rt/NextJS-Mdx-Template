# Must-Know Markdown Skills

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. In this post, we'll cover some essential Markdown skills that every writer should know.

## 1. Headers

You can create headers using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the header level:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

## 2. Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text using asterisks or underscores:

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

***You can combine them***

## 3. Lists

### Unordered Lists

You can create unordered lists using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens:

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Subitem 2.1
  * Subitem 2.2

### Ordered Lists

For ordered lists, simply use numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Subitem 3.1
   2. Subitem 3.2

## 4. Links

You can create links using square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL:

You can also add title text to links:

[Visit Google](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

## 5. Images

To add an image, use an exclamation mark, followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image in parentheses:

<img src="/images/graph.jpeg" alt="Alt text for the image" />

To center an image, we need to use HTML:

## 6. Code

For inline code, use backticks:

Use the `print()` function in Python.

For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```markdown
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

## 7. Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, use the `>` symbol:

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
>
> It can also have multiple paragraphs.

## 8. Horizontal Rules

You can create horizontal rules using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |

## 10. Task Lists

You can create task lists using brackets with a space or an 'x':

- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media


## 12. Strikethrough

You can strike through text using two tildes:

~~This text is no longer valid~~
